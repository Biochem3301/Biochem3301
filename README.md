# Biochem3301 Microbiome Project

This repository contains the codes used to submit scripts with QIIME and the relevant output files for the metagenomic analysis of the collected soil samples.


# Workflow

## 1. Raw Sequence Data Sorting

- Joining Forward and Reverse Reads
- Demultiplexing
- Picking OTUs with Closed Reference


## 2. Initial Data Analysis

- Rarefraction with sample depth = 650
- Core Diversity Analysis - inc. rarefraction with sample depth = 34,000


## 3. Taxonomy Analysis

- Plot Taxa Summary at Phylum-level
  - Heatmap
- Taxa Summary by category – Latitude, pH, Nitrogen, Phosphorus
  - Heatmap
  - Metadata Correlation

## 4. Alpha Diversity Analysis

- Alpha Diversity Comparison by category – pH, Nitrogen, Phosphorus
  - Observed Species
  - Chao1
  - Phylogenic Diversity


## 5. Beta Diversity Analysis

- 2D PCoA Beta Diversity Plots
